Identifying Key Drivers of Email Unsubscribes

---

About the Project: 

In todayâ€™s digital world, keeping customers engaged through email marketing is harder than ever. Many subscribers quietly disengage, opening fewer emails until they eventually hit unsubscribe. This project explores the key factors that lead to email unsubscribes, such as campaign type, timing, engagement behavior, and user demographics. Using SQL for data analysis and Tableau for visualization, the goal is to identify patterns that explain subscriber churn and propose actionable strategies to improve retention.
